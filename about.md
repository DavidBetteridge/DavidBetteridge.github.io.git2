Hi,  I'm one of the co-founders of [YorkDevelopers.org] and also organise the monthly YorkCodeDojo meetup.

### Proactis Limited

I work in a technical role for Proactis Limited and the views on this blog are mine and may not be those of Proactis.

### Ultra Runner

When I'm not coding or with my family then I'm normally out running.  I normally compete in the excellent series of Hardmoor races on the North York Moors.


### Contact me

If you wish to contact me then I'm @da_betteridge on Twitter,  or come and find me at the Code-and-Coffee meetup in York each Monday and Wednesday morning.
