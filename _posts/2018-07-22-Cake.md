title: Using Cake With TeamCity
---

We have been successfully using TeamCity to build one of our main products for the last year.  Although we were fairly happy with the process there was a few concerns around the solution.

1. The steps required to create a build are defined in TeamCity as a series of settings,  batch files and shell (dos) commands.  This meant that before making large configuration changes we had to backup TeamCity and then hope for the best.  This meant that we tended to avoid making major improvements to the process for fear of breaking something.

2. We have three branches (Release, Features and Patches) which inherit from a set of common templates.  This works fine for day-to-day operation,  but isn't ideal for when we need to make a change to just one branch (normally features).  After making and testing the change we have to remember to also make the same change to the common templates when features is merged into release.  This can be a couple of months after making the initial change.

3. Due to the number of steps in the build process (and there inter-dependencies) is it not possible to test the build configuration locally.
